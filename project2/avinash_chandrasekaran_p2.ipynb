    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup postings on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish between the topics based on the text of the posts. Whereas with digit classification, the input is relatively dense: a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero, here we'll represent each document with a \"bag-of-words\" model. As you'll see, this makes the feature representation quite sparse -- only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The bag-of-words assumption here is that the label depends only on the words; their order is not important.\n",

    "_K nearest neighbors uses values of features to calculate distances between observations. In this case the words in the documents are used as features. We have seen in # 2.f above, almost 25% of the words in the dev data set are not there in the vocabulary. This mismatch in features results in poorer performance by K nearest neighbors algorithm. Also, this method doesn't work well because the feature set is sparse and highly multidimensional along with small training set_\n",

    "_Logistic regresion doesn't work as well because the number of training examples is small in comparison with the number of features (2034 training examples vs 26879 features). The few training examples and high number of features make it relatively easier to estimate the joint probability (used in Naive Bayes) than the conditional probability used in logistic regression_\n",

    "(6) The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. That is, logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small size. The default regularization, L2, computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (see P3, above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. The result is that whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives lots of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Train a logistic regression model using a \"l1\" penalty. Output the number of learned weights that are not equal to zero. How does this compare to the number of non-zero weights you get with \"l2\"? Now, reduce the size of the vocabulary by keeping only those features that have at least one non-zero weight and retrain a model using \"l2\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Make a plot showing accuracy of the re-trained model vs. the vocabulary size you get when pruning unused features by adjusting the C parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The gradient descent code that trains the logistic regression model sometimes has trouble converging with extreme settings of the C parameter. Relax the convergence criteria by setting tol=.01 (the default is .0001)."

    "CountVectorizer creates a matrix where each cell represents the number of times the feature has appeared in a document. Whereas, TfidfVectorizer creates a matrix where each cell represents the Tf-idf weight of each feature in the document.\n",
    "Tf-idf of a feature is calculated in the following way: Term frequency X Inverse Document Frequency.\n",
    "Term Frequency = number of times a word appeared in a document / total number of words in the document\n",

    "As we can see from the Confusion Matrix, most errors are between 'talk.religion.misc' and 'alt.atheism'. From the label names it seems that words that are important to one label will be important to the other label as well. Hence the classifier is making errors. There are also several errors between 'comp.graphics' and 'alt.atheism'. The errors between 'comp.graphics' and 'alt.atheism' are caused by the presense of 'computer like' words such as internet, download and ftp.\n",
